                <p class="lead">Rare diseases affect over 300 million people worldwide. Yet the path to understanding,
                    treating, and curing these conditions is often overlooked. For the individuals and families
                    impacted, every day is a search—for answers, treatments, and hope.</p>

                <p>At JBK Search, we believe rare disease research deserves greater visibility, urgency, and investment.
                    It's not just a professional interest—it's deeply personal. We're proud to use our platform and
                    partnerships to champion the people and organizations working tirelessly to drive breakthroughs
                    forward.</p>

                <p>Let's explore why rare disease research is so critical, the challenges it faces, and the meaningful
                    ways we can all help make a difference.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">Why Rare Disease Research Matters</h2>
                <p>Each rare disease may affect only a small number of people—but together, their impact is profound.
                    For patients and families, the journey often involves delayed diagnoses, limited treatment options,
                    and significant emotional and financial challenges.</p>

                <p>Breakthroughs in rare disease research have the power to change lives—and not just for those directly
                    affected. Discoveries in this space often lead to broader medical innovations, paving the way for
                    new treatments and a deeper understanding of more common conditions.</p>

                <p>But reaching those breakthroughs is rarely easy.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">The Challenges Researchers Face</h2>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3" style="color: #439539;">1. Limited Funding and Awareness</h3>
                <p>Rare diseases tend to receive less public attention—and therefore less funding—compared to more
                    common conditions. This slows down the development of diagnostics and treatments.</p>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3" style="color: #439539;">2. Small Patient Populations</h3>
                <p>Fewer patients means less data, making it more difficult to conduct trials or prove a therapy's
                    effectiveness. Cross-sector collaboration becomes crucial here.</p>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3" style="color: #439539;">3. Complex Regulatory Pathways</h3>
                <p>When a treatment is developed, navigating approval processes is complex. Balancing urgency with
                    safety is a critical challenge—and that's where Regulatory Affairs professionals play a pivotal
                    role.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">Why This Work Is Personal to Us</h2>
                <p>Rare disease research is deeply personal to our team. Jake, our Director of Operations and our
                    founder Brenda's son, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17. This was a life-changing moment that
                    brought the challenges of living with and managing a rare condition into sharp focus. Not just
                    professionally, but personally.</p>

                <p>Jake's journey is a daily reminder of why this work matters. It fuels our commitment to supporting
                    those driving progress and inspires us to play our part in bridging the gap between discovery and
                    real-world impact for patients.</p>
