        <p class="lead">Jake Patterson brings a unique blend of strategic leadership, operational excellence, and a deep
            personal connection to healthcare innovation as JBK’s Director of Operations. With a bachelor’s degree in
            <span class="fw-bold">Arts and Entertainment Media Management</span> from <span class="fw-bold">Columbia
                College Chicago</span>, Jake has a sharp eye for detail and a
            commitment to driving efficiency in everything he does.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">At age 17, Jake was diagnosed with <span class="fw-bold">Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)</span>—a
            life-changing moment that only
            strengthened his resilience and determination. Like his sister, who lives with Cystic Fibrosis, Jake refused
            to let his diagnosis define him. Instead, he became an active participant in cutting-edge medical
            advancements, closely following <span class="fw-bold">clinical trials</span> and <span
                class="fw-bold">technological breakthroughs</span> in diabetes care. He was
            among the first to adopt the <span class="fw-bold">artificial pancreas</span> and <span
                class="fw-bold">insulin pump technology</span>, thanks to the innovations of
            <span class="fw-bold">Roche, Dexcom, and Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF)</span>.
        </p>
        <h1>Advocacy & Impact</h1>
