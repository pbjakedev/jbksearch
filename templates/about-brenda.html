    <div>
        <p class="lead">Hi, I’m Brenda Patterson, often called "The Headhunter with Skin in the Game." My journey in
            recruiting began in 1988, but it took on a deeper purpose when life presented me with profound challenges.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">In 1994, my daughter was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In 2006, my son was diagnosed with
            Type 1 Diabetes. These moments filled me with fear, but they also ignited a relentless drive to make a
            difference.</p>
        <p class="lead">The day after my daughter’s diagnosis, I found Dr. Steve Shak, the discoverer of Pulmozyme
            (Genentech’s breakthrough drug for CF). A week later, I connected with Frank DeFord, whose daughter had
            passed away from CF, and later met Boomer Esiason, whose son Gunnar has CF. Their guidance reshaped my
            perspective and fueled my mission: <span class="fw-bold">to be the very best recruiter in pharma,
                biotech, and medtech—because
                hiring the right people changes lives</span>
        </p>
        <h1>Results-Driven Recruiting with Purpose</h1>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Great recruiters don’t just fill positions—they drive innovation and progress. Over the
            years, I’ve built a reputation for delivering exceptional talent to companies at the forefront of medical
            advancements
