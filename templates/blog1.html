                <h2 class="h3 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">A Strategic Step Forward</h2>
                <p>At JBK Search, our mission has always been clear: to connect top talent with companies driving
                    innovation. We believe these connections have the power to change lives—accelerating medical
                    breakthroughs that help people live longer, healthier lives. With decades of experience in the
                    pharmaceutical and life sciences industries, we're excited to expand our existing focus in
                    Regulatory Affairs (RA) and grow this important area of our recruiting expertise.</p>

                <p>We've placed many talented Regulatory Affairs professionals over the years and are thrilled to
                    build
                    on this foundation by adding team members dedicated to serving the unique needs of this dynamic
                    sector.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">Why Regulatory Affairs Matters More Than Ever</h2>
                <p>Why the continued focus on Regulatory Affairs? It's simple: Regulatory Affairs is where
                    innovation
                    meets impact. As the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries evolve at lightning speed, RA
                    professionals are the ones working to ensure that advancements reach the market with precision
                    and
                    urgency. They play a crucial role in protecting public health, ensuring quality, and ultimately
                    delivering life-saving treatments to the people who need them most. It is a high-impact field,
                    and
                    we're honored to deepen our commitment to this space.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5 mb-4" style="color: #439539;">Our Commitment to Growth and Flexibility</h2>
                <p>For us, this shift is an opportunity to apply our established recruiting skills in new ways that
                    align with our company's mission. Brenda Patterson, our founder and lead recruiter, brings over
                    20
                    years of experience connecting top-tier industry professionals with transformative biopharma
                    companies. Our expanded focus on Regulatory Affairs reflects our 'why' at JBK: to cultivate
                    relationships that spark innovation, bring hope, and improve lives.</p>

                <p>In addition to building our Regulatory Affairs practice, we're also expanding into contract
                    staffing
                    recruitment. We recognize that companies increasingly need flexible staffing solutions to keep
                    pace
                    with changing demands. By offering contract staffing services, we can help organizations remain
                    efficient while giving professionals more diverse opportunities.</p>

                <p>While we've built a reputation as recruiting experts, we believe it's essential to always
                    maintain a
                    learner's mindset. The Regulatory Affairs industry is constantly evolving, and staying
                    open-minded
                    is how we grow and thrive. Our approach is rooted in adaptability—staying curious, embracing
                    fresh
                    ideas, and building meaningful relationships with the people we get to work with.</p>
