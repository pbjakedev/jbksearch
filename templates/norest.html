        <div class="section-header">Introduction</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            As a recruiter, often called "The Headhunter with Skin In The Game," the concept of #NoRest until a cure is
            found goes beyond my profession—it's personal. It's a promise to every patient and every family affected by
            disease, driven by an unwavering belief that we must do everything we can to help people live longer,
            healthier
            lives.

        <div class="section-header">The Roots of My Motivation </div>
        <div class="section-content lead highlight">
            My #NoRest mentality began in 1994. I had experienced record-breaking years as a recruiter specializing in
            the
            manufacturing industry. I changed my focus to the pharma/biotech/medical device industry when my daughter,
            Katelin, was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and my son, Jake, was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes
            (T1D).
            Doctors said there was no cure for Katelin and warned me of the life-threatening challenges for Jake. Then,
            as
            friends and families were diagnosed lung cancer, Multiple Myeloma, Prostate Cancer, Bile Duct Cancer, Acute
            Flaccid Myelitis, IPF, and other illnesses, my resolve deepened. I founded JBK Search to specialize in
            attracting and placing really great talent with passionate companies. Every story of a family battling
            disease
            reignites my passion. It’s a reminder that there’s still so much work to be done, and that each small
            victory
            brings us closer to making a difference.
            <h4>#NoRest isn’t just a slogan; it’s my commitment to those who need hope the most.</h4>

        <div class="section-header">The Personal Cost and Reward of the #NoRest Mentality</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            Living by the #NoRest mindset means long hours, personal sacrifices, and moments of doubt. But for me, those
            challenges are outweighed by the rewards—knowing that my efforts as a recruiter, and those of my clients and
            candidates might lead to easing suffering or extending someone's life. It’s the belief that every placement
            of
            talent can spark the next breakthrough in medical research.

        <div class="section-header">Defining Success in the Fight Against Disease </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            Success, to me, is about improving lives. It’s knowing that my work as a recruiter helped place the right
            people
            in the right roles, people who refuse to settle for "good enough."

        <div class="section-header">The Promise to #NoRest </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            My promise is simple: I’m committed to being a force that connects the best minds with the most innovative
            companies, working together to build a future where patients can live longer and healthier lives.
        </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">What Keeps Me Going – Hope! </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            What keeps me going is the difference companies like Vertex have made, especially seeing Trikafta transform
            my
            daughter’s life and the lives of countless others with CF. It's not just the facilities or labs that
            matter—it's
            the people who never gave up. These moments remind me why I chose this path of recruiting and why I’ll never
            stop pushing forward – Hope Springs Eternal.

            For me, it’s not about recognition; it’s about changing lives and standing with those who need hope the
            most.
            That’s what #NoRest means to me, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning and keeps me at my desk
            long
            past 5:00.
